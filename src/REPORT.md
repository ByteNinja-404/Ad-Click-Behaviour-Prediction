# Ad Click Prediction Project Report

## Problem Statement

In the digital advertising industry, the ability to predict which users will engage with ads is crucial for improving the return on investment (ROI) of advertising campaigns. By targeting users who are more likely to click on ads, businesses can optimize their advertising budget and drive more effective engagement.

This project addresses the problem of predicting user interaction with online advertisements. Specifically, the goal is to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on their demographic information (such as age, gender, and device type) and behavioral factors (such as browsing history and the time of day the ad is shown). The target variable for this prediction is whether or not the user clicked on the ad (`click = 1` for clicked, `click = 0` for no click).

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to **predict user click behavior on advertisements** using machine learning techniques. By analyzing user behavior and demographics, this project aims to:

1. **Understand user interaction patterns**: Identify which factors influence users to click on ads based on their age, gender, device type, and time of day.
2. **Develop a machine learning model**: Implement a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a user will click on an ad.
3. **Visualize insights**: Generate visualizations that highlight patterns and correlations in user engagement with ads.
4. **Evaluate model performance**: Assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in predicting ad clicks, and use metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its reliability.
5. **Provide actionable recommendations**: Based on the findings, suggest ways to optimize ad targeting strategies for better engagement.

By the end of the project, we aim to build a functional model capable of predicting ad clicks and offering insights that can be used for improving ad placement strategies in real-world applications.

## Methodology

The methodology for this project involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. Below is a breakdown of each step involved in this project:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in ensuring that the dataset is clean, consistent, and suitable for training the machine learning model. The preprocessing steps include:
- **Handling Missing Values**: 
  - Missing values in numerical columns (e.g., age) were filled with the median value of that column.
  - Missing values in categorical columns (e.g., gender, device type) were replaced with a placeholder value of 'Unknown'.
  
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: 
  - Categorical columns (e.g., gender, device type) were converted into numerical values using **Label Encoding** to make them compatible with the machine learning model.
  
- **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**: 
  - Non-numeric or irrelevant columns (e.g., `id`, `full_name`) were dropped from the dataset to ensure that only relevant features are used for training.

- **Feature Scaling**: 
  - Although not explicitly required in Random Forest Classifiers, scaling could be performed if needed. In this project, feature scaling was skipped as it doesn't typically affect tree-based models.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps to understand the structure of the dataset and detect patterns or relationships between different features. Key tasks include:
- **Data Visualization**: 
  - Multiple visualizations were created to explore the relationships between different variables, such as:
    - **Age Distribution**: Shows the frequency of users in different age groups.
    - **Click Rate by Gender**: Compares the click behavior between male and female users.
    - **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlights correlations between numerical features to understand feature dependencies.
  
- **Pattern Detection**: 
  - The visualizations helped in detecting significant patterns, such as:
    - Higher engagement among specific age groups.
    - Gender-based variations in click behavior.
    - Correlation between ad position and click-through rate.

### 3. Model Building
The machine learning model was built using the following steps:
- **Model Choice**: 
  - A **Random Forest Classifier** was selected due to its ability to handle large datasets and perform well with both categorical and numerical features.
  
- **Training the Model**: 
  - The model was trained using the preprocessed data, with **80% of the data** used for training and the remaining **20% for testing**.
  
- **Hyperparameters**: 
  - Default hyperparameters were used for the Random Forest model. However, hyperparameter tuning (e.g., adjusting the number of trees) could further improve performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
After training the model, it was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- **Precision**: Evaluates how many of the positive predictions were actually correct.
- **Recall**: Measures how many actual positive cases were identified by the model.
- **F1-Score**: Provides a balance between precision and recall.
  
These metrics were used to assess how well the model performed in predicting whether a user would click on an ad.

### 5. Model Saving and Deployment
Once the model was trained and evaluated, it was saved to disk using the `joblib` library for future use. This allows the model to be loaded later for predictions without needing to retrain it.

This methodology ensures that the project follows a systematic approach to data preparation, model training, and evaluation. The focus is on delivering a reliable, scalable model that can be used for predicting ad clicks in real-world scenarios.

## Conclusion

The Ad Click Prediction project demonstrates the power of machine learning in understanding user behavior and predicting ad engagement. The key findings and outcomes of the project are summarized below:

### Key Findings:
1. **Model Performance**: 
   - The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved an **accuracy of 71%**, which shows that the model can predict ad click behavior with reasonable accuracy. The model performed better at predicting clicks (class 1) than non-clicks (class 0), as indicated by its higher recall for class 1.
   
2. **User Insights**: 
   - **Age and Gender**: The visualizations revealed that certain age groups and genders are more likely to engage with ads.
   - **Ad Position**: The position of the advertisement on the webpage was found to have a strong correlation with the likelihood of a user clicking on the ad.
   
3. **Feature Correlations**: 
   - The correlation heatmap showed interesting relationships between features such as `ad_position`, `device_type`, and `age`. Understanding these correlations is key for improving ad targeting.

### Model Limitations:
- **Imbalanced Classes**: The dataset had an imbalance between click and non-click samples, which affected the model's performance, particularly for class 0 (non-clicks).
- **Feature Selection**: While significant features like `age`, `device_type`, and `ad_position` were used, further analysis could uncover additional useful features.

### Future Work:
1. **Improved Model**: 
   - Hyperparameter tuning and the use of more advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) could improve the modelâ€™s performance.
   
2. **Data Augmentation**: 
   - Incorporating more data or addressing class imbalances using techniques like SMOTE could enhance the model's prediction accuracy for the underrepresented class.
   
3. **Real-Time Prediction**: 
   - Developing a system that can make real-time ad click predictions would significantly enhance the practical application of this model.

### Overall Impact:
This project shows that machine learning can be effectively applied to predict ad engagement and provide actionable insights. With further tuning and improvements, this model can be deployed in real-world ad targeting systems, helping businesses optimize their ad campaigns for better user engagement.

The findings and model provide a foundation for future work in ad click prediction and could serve as the basis for building more sophisticated recommendation systems.
